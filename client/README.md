# Star Wars The Info Guide client side.

## RED space guide (Frontend UI)
Using React, create a UI that allows you to select a Star Wars character by name (you can
hardcode a list of names tied to their Star Wars api ids) and also let you lookup a person by
id to display the endpoint information in a visually pleasing way.
Have as much fun with the layout and design as you wish.
